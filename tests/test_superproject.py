"""superproject integration falsifier — the harness organs map onto the flagship spine.

Five organs (perception, verification, structure, orchestration, reconciliation), each a
flagship peer plus its native harness cluster, composing over the flagships' own
next-action routing. The spine must be CLOSED (no dangling route) and telos the reconciler.
