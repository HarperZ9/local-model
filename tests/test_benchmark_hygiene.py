"""The benchmark defect gate: 398 certified-defective statements were
found across five published Lean benchmarks (lean-invention dossier,
2026-07-14). This gate catches the two mechanical defect classes before
a statement enters any lane here: `sorry` (an admitted hole wearing a
theorem's name) and nonstandard axioms (acceptance smuggled in through
an assumed falsehood). Clean statements pass; every flag names its
statement and its reason."""
