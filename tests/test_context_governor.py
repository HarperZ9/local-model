"""The context governor: keep any model inside its reliable zone.

Nominal context is not reliable context; models degrade before their
stated limit (lost-in-the-middle, RULER). The governor curates the
window to a per-model reliable budget, and the load-bearing rule is the
governance-decay fix: a pinned constraint NEVER leaves the window, so
compaction cannot silently drop the thing holding the model correct.
Everything evicted is folded with a recall hash, so nothing is lost,
only moved. Model-agnostic: it operates on items and a token budget,
never on weights.
