"""The arms driver: its refusals, its bound accept, and its kept refusal.

Three things are worth testing here and one of them is easy to miss.

  * The run_end guard must produce a clean refusal and exit 3, not a traceback.
    It did produce a traceback at first, because the module was importlib-loaded
    twice and the two EndpointGate classes were not the same class.
  * Every accept function must be BOUND to the instance, or an arm scores a
    certificate for an easier problem as a pass.
  * The self-scored comparison must still be REFUSED in the output. Deleting the
    call would hide the enforcement rather than demonstrate it.
