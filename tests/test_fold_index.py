"""test_fold_index.py — recall verbatim facts from folded context, no embeddings.

Success criteria:
  - add + recall returns the span whose content matches the query, ranked.
  - a rarer query term surfaces the more specific span first.
  - the same span hash is never indexed twice; empty query -> [].
  - the index persists across instances.
  - index_compaction indexes exactly what a real compaction folded away, and the
    fact is recallable afterward.
