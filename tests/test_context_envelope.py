"""Falsifiers for the context-envelope producer (harness/context_envelope.py).

Gap D: the index lane becomes a real catalog inside Flywheel. The producer must
call the index lane, return a project-telos.context-envelope/v1 document, stamp
a stable fingerprint over unchanged content, and degrade to UNVERIFIABLE (never
crash) when the lane is unavailable.
