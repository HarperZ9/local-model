"""consensus_select contract — the oracle-free behavioral selector must pick
the majority-behavior candidate, and must never lose the single-shot passer.

This is the load-bearing property of the verified_consensus arm: the model
authors nothing; selection is by behavioral agreement on a pre-decided input
battery. If a wrong plurality could displace a lone correct temp-0 candidate,
the arm would report false losses; the tie-break to index 0 prevents that.
