"""correlation-steered compute falsifier (#5).

Properties (honestly scoped — the mechanism is adaptive allocation; the slice is
correlation-collapse as the trigger):
  - a collapsed wave redirects budget to diversity (boost + minimal spend);
  - a healthy wave verifies (spends the budget);
  - budget is conserved across a steered run;
  - on a collapse-then-decorrelate sequence, steering spends less verifying the
    collapsed wave than flat-N would.
