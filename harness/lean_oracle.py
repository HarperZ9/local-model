"""lean_oracle.py -- the apex oracle: the kernel decides, nothing else.

Aria (arXiv 2607.06341) is the existence proof for this architecture: give
an agent full freedom and let a proof kernel be the sole acceptance
authority -- the proof object IS the receipt. This is that lane on Lean 4:
candidate code is written to a file, `lean` checks it, and the verdict is
the kernel's exit. No learned model, no heuristic, no partial credit. The
receipt carries the code hash, the toolchain identity, and the kernel's
own words on failure. A missing toolchain is a DECLARED state (passed:
null), never a fake pass -- and the strongest claim this platform can ever
carry is one this oracle accepted.
