"""run_review.py -- the reviewability projection of a witnessed agent run.

The industry split this serves: expert reviewers want to know what the
model did and why; learners inherit endings without middles. Every agent
run already carries a hash-chained ledger -- this module projects it into
the terms a senior reviewer checks first:

- edited_unread     files the run edited without ever reading first
                    (the classic "went too far" scar);
- unverified_edits  edits no oracle covered afterwards (nothing green ran
                    after the change);
- failed_calls      the retry scars, kept visible -- where the first cut
                    was not deep enough;
- reviewability     re-derivable arithmetic over those named signals.

Everything here is a FACT from the ledger. No generated narrative is ever
mixed in; if a surface wants prose on top, it must label the prose as
prose. That separation is the whole point.
