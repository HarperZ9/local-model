"""science_bench.py -- the science workbench: evidence, spec, judgment, one chain.

The mature spin on model-assisted science: the model proposes, the
instruments dispose. One run chains three stages that already exist as
accountable tools:

- gather   arXiv intake with provenance receipts (the gather lane's CLI);
- forge    the question priced as a research PRP: validation gates marked
           by what an external check can run, confidence from that ratio;
- crucible witnessed judgment of the stated claims: a claim with no
           measurement comes back UNVERIFIABLE, sealed, and it STAYS that
           way on the surface -- an unmeasured claim is never accepted.

Every stage failure is a named error while the rest of the run continues,
and the whole run folds into one chain hash a third party can recompute
from the payload. Nothing here fires on its own; a run is a request.
