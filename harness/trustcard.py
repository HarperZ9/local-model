"""trustcard.py — detached signature + machine-readable trust card for wiki nodes.

A plain content hash proves integrity to anyone who can recompute it; it does NOT
prove WHO sealed it. A detached HMAC signature does: only a holder of the signing
key can produce it, so a node's seal is attributable to our harness, and any edit
(or a forged node without the key) fails verification. Paired with a TrustCard —
author, provenance verdict, freshness, scan status, signature — this is the
"inline trust rendering" the dive named (NVIDIA-Verified-Skills SKILLCARD), so
trust metadata is visible at point of use, not buried in a registry.

Honest labeling: this is an HMAC (symmetric — integrity + signer-authenticity
under a shared key), NOT a public-key signature (no non-repudiation to third
parties). For local provenance that is the right, zero-dependency tool; a real
detached OMS/PKI signature is the upgrade if third-party verification is needed.
