"""loops.py -- which other loops close?

The flywheel is one operation: perceive, check against an unauthored
criterion, carry a re-checkable receipt, feed it back. The code loop closed
(README: 9/9). This module asks the wider question as an EXPERIMENT, not a
diagram: for each candidate loop, run every handoff against the real local
mechanisms and report whether it closes -- every edge executed, every edge
chained a receipt, and the last edge feeds the first. An edge that cannot
run is named open with its reason. Nothing here asserts closure it did not
witness.

Candidate loops:
  learning   comprehension receipt -> ledger -> retention due -> retest
             -> ledger (does understanding compound?)
  economics  run cost -> meter -> routing receipt -> next run
             (does cost feedback steer routing?)
  invention  propose conjecture -> kernel verdict -> survivors stored
             -> seed next proposals (does generation-under-witness close?)
  research   question -> gather source -> forge spec -> witnessed verdict
             -> stored claim (does the reconcile generalize past code?)
