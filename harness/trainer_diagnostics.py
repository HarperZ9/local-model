"""trainer_diagnostics.py -- the frozen trainer-diagnostics contract, as code.

The frozen preregistration deliberately does not implement RL training:
PolicyOptimizer stays an unimplemented Protocol (harness/rl_from_oracle.py).
This module does not change that. It implements the schema and validator that
project-docs/prereg/2026-07-27-trainer-diagnostics-addendum.md freezes, so a
future trainer cannot pick which diagnostics to report after seeing its own
result. The addendum's Section 2 is the source of truth; this module mirrors
it and binds to it by hash so a run can cite the exact frozen text it was
checked against.

The two literature findings behind the contract (arXiv:2601.11061,
arXiv:2512.16912, arXiv:2605.18864, cited in full in the addendum) are that a
verified-reward gain and a spurious-reward gain look identical on pass@1
alone. policy_entropy exposes an entropy-collapse gain; pass_at_k across k
exposes an elicitation gain. Both are required fields, not optional ones.

A missing field is a bug in the writer: the addendum requires every field be
emitted, with an honest null where a measurement could not be taken, so a
missing measurement stays distinguishable from a missing writer. Four fields
carry no honest null (arm, rung, step, n_eval): a record with no arm identity
or no denominator is not a record. Stdlib only.
