"""discovery_flywheel.py -- sense the shifting field, gate what we adopt, flag
when to change course. The self-growth loop, kept honest.

The field moves fast; the operator wants the system to notice new discoveries and
adapt. This composes the pieces that already exist rather than inventing an
"oracle" that senses discoveries -- because there is no ground-truth oracle for
"is this a real discovery worth adopting"; that is a JUDGEMENT, and putting a
learned judge on the accept path is exactly the C2 violation the engine forbids.

The honest decomposition:
  - SENSE (the edge, ML on the PROPOSE side): a frontier sweep (LLM agents + live
    web) proposes discovery candidates. Off the accept path. Lives upstream; this
    module consumes its OUTPUT, it does not fetch.
  - GATE (native, C2-clean): a discovery enters the ADOPTABLE lane only if it
    carries a runnable FALSIFIER. No falsifier -> demoted to inspiration, full
    stop. That rule is enforced here at intake, before evolve.py's own gating
    (which further forces every code/capability change into the never-auto-apply
    lane). The falsifier -- a real oracle that fires or does not -- is the only
    thing that lets a change land. The matmul oracle shipped this way; J-lens
    stayed a wedge because its falsifier needs a GPU.
  - DRIFT (native, transition-fired): watch the stream of ACTIONABLE discoveries
    over time; when a domain outside the current course accumulates enough
    adoptable threads, RECOMMEND a course change -- once, on the transition, not
    every observation. It recommends; it never re-prioritizes the roadmap itself.

No learned model decides adoption; no code is auto-applied; no course auto-changes.
What compounds is the FLOOR: each turn that lands a falsifier-gated change raises
the baseline the next turn starts from (evolve.py's discipline), and the drift
signal keeps the loop pointed at where the field actually moved.
