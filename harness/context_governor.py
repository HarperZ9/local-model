"""context_governor.py -- keep any model inside its reliable zone.

The wrapper cannot enlarge a model's attention; it can only curate what
occupies the window. Nominal context is not reliable context (models
degrade before their stated limit: lost-in-the-middle, RULER), so the
governor fills the window only to a per-model RELIABLE budget, set from
measurement, not up to the nominal cap.

The load-bearing rule is the governance-decay fix (measured: naive
compaction raised constraint violations 0 -> 30%+, pinning restored 0):
a pinned constraint NEVER leaves the window. If the pins alone exceed
the reliable budget the governor says so (over_pinned) rather than
eating a constraint, because a dropped constraint is a mistake, not a
saving. Everything evicted is FOLDED with a content hash, so a buried
fact is recallable verbatim, never lost. Model-agnostic by construction:
it operates on items and a token budget, so ChatGPT, Claude, or a local
model all route through the same curation, each with its own reliable
budget.

An item is {id, role, text, score?, tokens?}. role is 'pin' (a
constraint that must survive), 'evidence', or 'history'. score ranks
non-pins for keep-or-fold; tokens overrides the estimator when the
caller knows the true count.
