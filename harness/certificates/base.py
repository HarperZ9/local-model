"""base.py -- the certificate oracle: read the data, never run it.

A construction certificate is a data structure and validating one is arithmetic.
This module imports nothing that can execute: no subprocess, no socket, no
ctypes, no pickle, no importlib, no eval. A test asserts that structurally,
because the property is what makes handing a verifier to a stranger safe instead
of handing them a way to run code on their machine.

Three things the base does so no subclass has to remember them:

  1. **Envelope before dispatch.** Declared parameters outside the criterion's
     scope bounds yield UNVERIFIABLE with OUT_OF_SCOPE, and `check` is never
     called. Out of scope is not wrong: scoring FAIL there would teach a policy
     to avoid legal regions of the parameter space for no reason.
  2. **Canonical hashing.** The output hash is over the canonicalized
     certificate plus the verdict, so two semantically identical certificates
     that differ only in key order agree, and a stranger re-deriving the hash
     does not disagree over formatting.
  3. **Coverage, always.** Every result carries what the check did NOT cover,
     and mechanically derives `does_not_prove` entries from it. A receipt that
     reports only its proof is how a true explanation becomes a fake passport.
