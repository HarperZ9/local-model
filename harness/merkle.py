"""merkle.py — an RFC 6962 / RFC 9162 style Merkle tree for receipt corpora (zero-dep).

The projected world hashes its receipts into one root. A flat concat-hash proves the
whole set at once but cannot prove a SINGLE receipt without rehashing everything. A
Merkle tree fixes that: a compact audit path (log n sibling hashes) proves one leaf
is in the tree, so a stranger verifies one receipt offline in log n work regardless
of corpus size, and any tampering moves the root.

Domain-separated hashing (leaves prefixed 0x00, internal nodes 0x01) is the standard
that prevents second-preimage attacks. Standard library (hashlib) only.

# whether the tree was rewritten. A consistency proof answers the other question:
# given an OLD root a stranger already holds, does the NEW tree contain the old
# tree unchanged as a prefix?

# That is the difference between append-only as a policy and append-only as a
# property. Without it a maintainer can rebuild the log with an entry removed and
# every inclusion proof for the surviving entries still verifies against the new
# root.
#
# The verifier below is a RECURSIVE MIRROR of the generator rather than the usual
# iterative bit-twiddling formulation. Both are correct; this one can be checked
# against the RFC's SUBPROOF definition line by line, and the iterative version
# is where implementations go wrong.
