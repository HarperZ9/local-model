"""prompt_forge.py -- turn a vague goal into a structured, criterion-bearing task.

The project's thesis: "a world already decided for the acting model makes it
perform better; the more it 'thinks', the dumber it gets." A good prompt IS that
pre-decided world -- it pins the role, the context, the constraints, the output
contract, and, above all, a CHECKABLE SUCCESS CRITERION the model did not author.
So this is not a template toy: it forces the same criterion-first discipline the
flywheel runs on. Give it a goal and it returns a prompt whose success is
verifiable -- and if the goal admits no checkable criterion, it says so and
proposes one, because an unverifiable task is the quiet failure of every
prompt-and-pray workflow.

Deterministic and zero-dep: it classifies the task, infers constraints from the
goal's own words, and assembles the prompt. No model call is required (an optional
refine hook can hand the draft to a proposer, but the criterion-forcing core is
rule-based so it never depends on the thing it is trying to make reliable).
