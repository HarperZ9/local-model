"""tasks_physics.py — the physics lane: tasks whose oracles ARE the physics.

The frontier discipline applied to computational physics: every task's
hidden tests check a conservation law, an analytic limit, or a convergence
order — criteria nature wrote, not the model. Same self-validating rule as
every lane: a reference solution that fails its own physics is a broken
benchmark and never ships. This is the seed lane; growth follows the same
curator gates as hard_v2.
