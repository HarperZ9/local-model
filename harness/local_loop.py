"""local_loop.py — the agentic loop: local model + gated tools + witnessed ledger.

This is what turns the chat client into an actual local coding agent. The model
proposes tool calls in the text protocol, the executor runs them under the gate,
observations are fed back, and the whole trajectory (turns + tool calls +
results) is appended to a hash-chained SessionLedger. The loop terminates when
the model stops emitting TOOL lines (final answer) or max_steps is hit — always
returning a re-verifiable checkpoint.

    With `test_cmd`, the loop is a TEST-REPAIR loop: when the model believes it is
    done, the test command is run and, if it fails, the failure is fed back and
    the model keeps working until the tests pass (or steps run out). The result
    then carries `tests_pass`, and the whole edit->test->repair trajectory is
    witnessed in the ledger -- a provable "made the tests green".

    With `criteria` (an acceptance_criteria.new_criteria() list), the loop will
    not report done while any criterion is still FAILING: at the point it would
    finish, the failing ids are handed back as the next message instead, and the
    check is witnessed as a "criteria" ledger entry. Nothing here flips a
    criterion: only apply_oracle_result does, either by a caller directly or,
    when `test_cmd` and a criterion registered to oracle "test_cmd" are both
    present, by this loop applying that test run's outcome. `max_steps` is the
    ultimate backstop: it still ends the run even with criteria unmet, honestly
    (never reports accepted) rather than looping forever.

    `budget_note`, off by default so an existing caller's ledger shape and
    prompts are untouched, prefixes each message sent to the model with the
    remaining step count and witnesses it as a "budget" ledger entry every
    turn, independent of `criteria`; opt in with budget_note=True. The
