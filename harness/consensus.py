"""consensus.py — non-learned verifier ensembling and stability replay.

Combining several INDEPENDENT, non-learned checks beats any single verifier
(Weaver / FUSE / BoN-MAV, 2025): a wrong answer must fool all of them, not one.
Flywheel's Oracle protocol makes this a pure composition. Each member still
accepts on its own falsifiable check, and the combiner is fixed arithmetic a
third party re-runs, so the C2 invariant (no learned model on the accept path)
holds and the verdict stays re-checkable. The receipt hash folds every member's
verdict, so a stranger reproduces the combined decision offline.

- ConsensusOracle: run N member oracles, accept per a fixed rule (all / any /
  majority / weighted-threshold).
- RepeatConsistencyOracle: run one oracle k times and require a STABLE, agreeing
  pass. A flaky / nondeterministic "pass" (order-dependent shortcut, timing race)
  is refused. Isomorphic-perturbation replay, non-learned.
