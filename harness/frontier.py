"""frontier.py -- the RAM/compute frontier, measured on this machine.

The field's answer to trillion-parameter economics is architectural --
MoE active-parameter budgets, hybrid linear attention (Ling/Ring 2.6,
arXiv 2606.15079), disk-streamed experts (Colibri) -- and every one of
those claims arrives as someone else's number on someone else's hardware.
This module is the platform's answer: a model earns its roster place
through a CAPABILITY PROBE run here (tokens/sec, latency, output hash),
and the frontier table composes probes with the uplift bench's verified
rates into capability-per-GB -- so 'which model should this machine run'
is decided by receipts produced on this machine, never by imported
leaderboards. The verified loop is part of the economics: the bench
already showed a 1.8GB model's pass rate doubling under an external
check, which changes what 'enough model' means.
