"""budget_control.py — correlation-collapse as a verification-budget controller (#5).

The one honestly-novel slice (the mechanism itself — adaptive/successive-halving
budget allocation — is well-known prior art): use the wrong-attractor correlation
statistic (search.max_pairwise_correlation) as the trigger. When a candidate wave
COLLAPSES (near-identical = fake agreement, §8), verifying more of the same wastes
budget; REDIRECT it to a diversity-boosted re-sample instead. When the wave is
diverse, proceed to verify. Budget is CONSERVED (reallocation, not addition).

Honest scope: this is adaptive allocation with a correlation trigger; it only wins
when the diversity boost actually decorrelates the next wave (it may not — that is
the falsifiable risk, and flat-N is the fallback). Never accepts on correlation;
the terminal oracle still disposes (C2).
