"""tree_head.py -- sign the tree head, so append-only stops being our word.

Phase 1C Task 2 was named "consistency proofs and signed tree head". The
consistency proofs landed and are tested, including the doctored-log attack. The
head did not: `Ledger.head()` returns a plain dict, and `grep sign ledger.py`
finds one hit, in a docstring. This module closes that, and it exists because of
two outside documents rather than because of a test failure.

RFC 9162 (Certificate Transparency 2.0) obsoletes the RFC 6962 that `merkle.py`
implements. The `0x00` leaf / `0x01` node domain separation is unchanged, so the
tree code stays correct. What 9162 adds is at the record level: `log_id` in both
proof structures, and a `TreeHeadDataV2` carrying a timestamp inside a
`SignedTreeHeadDataV2` wrapper. The Sigstore client spec says why: a verifier
validates inclusion against a SIGNED head, and should obtain that head in a way
that prevents the log from equivocating.

Equivocation is a log showing two different views to two different readers. Our
answer is the contest channel plus a head a stranger keeps. But a consistency
proof between two roots the PRESENTER chose only shows the presenter can produce
a self-consistent pair. Without a signature over the head, a stranger holding an
old head is trusting us rather than checking us, and anti-equivocation is
asserted rather than held. That is what this module is for.

Three deliberate choices:

  1. **The ledger never touches key material.** `sign_head` takes a callable and
     a public key. The private key stays wherever the caller keeps it, which is
     the standing rule that a signing key never reaches a receipt, a log, or a
     ledger.
  2. **The timestamp is passed in, never read from the clock.** A signed head is
     not reproducible by construction, and that is fine because the head is an
     attestation ABOUT the tree rather than part of it. The root stays
     timestamp-free, so replaying the tree is unaffected. Reading a clock in here
     would make every caller's output un-pinnable for no gain.
  3. **Domain separation against receipt signatures.** A head signature and a
     receipt signature are both Ed25519 over bytes we chose. Without a distinct
     prefix, a head signature could be presented as a receipt signature or the
     reverse. The prefix makes the two preimage spaces disjoint.

`log_id` is the sha256 of the log's public key, following 9162. It binds the
identity of a log to WHO attests to it rather than to what happens to be inside
it, which is the property that makes a proof non-transferable between logs. A
ledger with no key has no honest log id, so it reports `None` and says so in
`does_not_prove` rather than inventing one from a path.
