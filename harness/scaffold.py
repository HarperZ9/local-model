"""scaffold.py -- the organs fire on every message, or they are not organs.

A tool the model must remember to call is a tool that gets skipped.
This layer runs the reconcile's guarantees per turn, model-independent:

  pre-pass   every source the prompt names is frozen (snapshot, hash)
             before the model answers; failures are DEGRADED entries
             with reasons, never fabricated hashes, never a blocked turn
  post-pass  the turn chains a receipt (prompt hash, answer hash, frozen
             sources) into the audit ledger, and any citations the
             answer carries are re-sliced and verified

Wrappers compose it: the gateway routes call it inline; external
harnesses (hooks, agents) can reach the same guarantees through
/api/route's scaffold field. The scaffold never edits the answer and
never blocks on a dead source: perception failure is reported, not
hidden, and the answer ships with its honesty visible.
