"""web_snapshot.py -- the citation, frozen. Zero-dep.

Kage (new-entrant sweep) packs deterministic byte-identical website
archives; the import for a research platform is sharper and smaller: when
gather cites a source, freeze the EXACT BYTES that were read as a
content-addressed archive. The hash is the receipt; any quotation or
extraction is re-checkable against those bytes offline, forever, even
after the page changes or dies. Same bytes, same hash, same file:
idempotent by construction. A failed fetch is a named error -- an empty
archive pretending to be evidence would be worse than none.
