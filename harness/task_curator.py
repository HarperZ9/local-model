"""task_curator.py: admission gates for the N>=100 hard set.

The uplift question stays open until a hard set exists where single-shot does
not saturate (FLAGSHIP-PLAN.md, lane #7), and curation is the slow part. The
failure mode of hand-curating 100 tasks is quality decay: task 87 gets vacuous
tests, task 92 leaks its solution into the prompt, and the eventual eval
measures nothing. This mechanizes admission — a candidate task enters the
registry only through gates, so the set grows across sessions without decaying.

The gates (all must pass to ADMIT; each failure names itself):
  reference_passes   the reference solution passes its own hidden tests
                     (tasks_lib.validate_spec, the existing discipline)
  oracle_can_fail    a derived return-None stub FAILS the hidden tests — the
                     per-task version of "a verifier that cannot fail verifies
                     nothing". Vacuous tests are the quiet killer of pass@k.
  deterministic      the reference passes twice in fresh workdirs (flaky
                     hidden tests would witness DRIFT on honest re-runs)
  no_solution_leak   no substantive solution line appears in the prompt
  edge_coverage      >= MIN_TESTS hidden test functions (edge-heavy by design)
  dedup              task_id and normalized solution body are new vs the
                     existing registries

Fail closed: a solution the stub-deriver cannot parse is REJECTED (no stub, no
falsification check, no admission). Admitted tasks persist as JSONL data, not
code, so the set grows without growing Python files.
