"""knowledge_graph.py -- one graph over every surface, with priced context.

The index lane's niche made concrete on the gateway: a single typed graph a
person, a model, and the desktop all read the same way. Nodes are the live
surfaces (lanes, projects with their index summaries, memory, plugins,
workflows); every node carries `signals` (the named, mechanical inputs) and a
`priority` computed ONLY from those signals -- no vibes, and the arithmetic is
re-checkable from the payload itself.

Context prioritization is the point: `context_plan(nodes, budget)` returns
the deterministic greedy order that fits a context budget, with the excluded
count visible. That is memory management a model can trust: what enters the
window is ranked by measured liveness, salience, and recency, and what was
cut is counted, never silently dropped.

A surface that cannot be read becomes an `error` node. The graph never
pretends a blind spot is an empty region.
