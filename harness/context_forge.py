"""context_forge.py -- context engineering with a verifier that can't be gamed.

Cole Medin's context-engineering method (github.com/coleam00/context-engineering-intro)
is right that a task needs a whole CONTEXT, not a clever prompt: rules, examples,
docs, and -- the load-bearing part -- VALIDATION GATES the work must pass, with an
execute loop that "iterates until all validations succeed." That loop is exactly
this project's flywheel. The one difference is the whole thesis: his gates are
tests the model runs on ITSELF (self-verification, which a model can claim passed);
ours are EXTERNAL oracles the model cannot author or fake (C2). Our own ablation
measured the gap -- self-test selection earned +0, an external oracle +20 -- so a
PRP is only as strong as how EXTERNALLY-CHECKABLE its gates are.

So this builds a PRP (Product Requirements Prompt) on top of prompt_forge's
criterion-bearing spec, and scores confidence by the fraction of its validation
gates a non-self-authored oracle could run -- not a vibe. A PRP whose gates are all
subjective is honestly low-confidence; one whose gates are machine-checkable is the
"working first try" context engineering promises, backed by a check that can fail.
