"""conjecture_forge.py -- generation under witness: propose, judge, keep.

The invention loop's depth question: can the loop produce a conjecture
nobody seeded? This is the mechanized, honest version of the answer: a
deterministic enumeration over a linear Nat-arithmetic grammar PROPOSES
universally quantified equations; the Lean kernel (or an injected judge)
is the sole acceptance authority; novelty is CORPUS-RELATIVE, measured
by normalized-statement hash against everything the store already holds,
so the forge never re-proposes the corpus. A refused conjecture is a
count, never a stored fact. A DECLARED kernel (no toolchain) yields no
claims at all. Novelty here means "absent from the corpus", nothing
grander -- the receipt says so.
