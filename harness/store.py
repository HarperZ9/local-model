"""store.py -- the verifiable enterprise substrate (stdlib sqlite3, zero-dep).

A persistent entity/relation store where every record is content-addressed
and every write is appended to a hash-chained audit ledger the owner can
re-verify. This is the backbone under projects, memory, and the knowledge
graph: it is not bigger than an enterprise data platform, it is
self-verifying -- a tampered record or a rewritten history is detectable by
walking the chain, which those platforms do not hand the customer.

Entities and relations carry a `project` scope so one store holds many
workspaces. The DB lives at FLYWHEEL_HOME/store.db; a fresh connection per
call keeps it correct under the threaded gateway. Values are the caller's;
nothing here reaches outside the file."""
