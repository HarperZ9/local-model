"""tool_rescue.py -- repairs under witness, never silent fixes.

The Forge pattern (Show HN 2026-05-19): a validate/rescue/retry proxy
lifts small-model tool-calling substantially -- but its repairs happen
silently inside the proxy. This import keeps the lift and adds the
witness: each rescue is a NAMED deterministic transform, and the record
of what was repaired (original line, transform, repaired line) travels
with the calls so the ledger can carry it. A transform either produces a
call the strict parser accepts, or the emission stays garbage -- rescue
never invents intent.
