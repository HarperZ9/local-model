"""receipt_sign.py -- attach a signature, and let a stranger check it.

The verification path here touches only `receipt`, `receipt_fields`, and
`ed25519_verify`, all stdlib-only. A person who distrusts the author can still
establish what the author's machine concluded, on a bare interpreter, offline.

Four disciplines:

1. THE SIGNATURE COVERS `claim_sha256`, per SIGNED_OVER fixed in receipt.py.
   Verification RECOMPUTES that digest from the receipt body rather than trusting
   the recorded one. A verifier that trusted the recorded digest would be
   verifying a signature over a number instead of over a claim, which is the
   difference between a receipt and a decoration.

2. A SIGNATURE MAY NOT DECLARE ITS OWN COVERAGE. `signed_over` travels in the
   envelope for a reader's benefit, but a mismatch against the code constant is a
   refusal. If a receipt could narrow its own coverage it would narrow it to
   nothing.

3. HMAC IS LOCAL ONLY. Verifying an HMAC requires the secret, and a stranger who
   holds the signing secret is not a third party. So HMAC signatures are marked
   non-exportable, refuse to verify against anything but their own secret, and are
   STRIPPED by `pack_for_export`, which adds the honest non-claim in their place.

4. AN ABSENT OR UNKNOWN ALGORITHM IS A NAMED REFUSAL, never a silent pass and
   never a bare False. "This receipt is unsigned" and "this signature is wrong"
   are different facts and a reader needs both.

This module does not generate keys and does not sign with Ed25519. `ed25519_attach`
takes a signature produced elsewhere. The asymmetry is deliberate: a verifier is a
stranger who must need nothing, a signer is the author who already has tooling, and
a pure-Python signer would invite key generation with an unaudited RNG.
