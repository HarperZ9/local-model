"""uplift_bench.py -- does the wrapper measurably uplift the model? Paired arms.

The one claim the operator wants ("Flywheel raises any model to its best
performance") is only ever earned per metric, per family, with an interval.
This bench runs the SAME task set through the SAME provider twice:

- bare     one candidate, graded by the external oracle (what a raw call or a
           thin web app gives you);
- wrapped  the verified loop: up to n candidates, the FIRST one the oracle
           accepts wins. The oracle disposes; the wrapper only proposes more.

The delta row carries a Newcombe (1998) score interval on the uplift, and an
interval that includes zero is flagged `includes_zero` with a "no uplift
claimed" note -- the honest null is a first-class result, never dressed up.
Latency and candidate counts are reported per arm because the wrapper COSTS
time and tokens; a bench that hid the overhead would be lying by omission.

Honesty is mechanical, exactly as in quality_duel: injected proposers mark
every row evidence="synthetic" (tests can never masquerade as measurements),
unverifiable tasks leave the pass-rate denominator visibly, and nothing
imports this module and fires a quota-consuming run on its own -- a live run
is an operator decision.
