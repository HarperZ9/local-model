"""gateway_auth.py -- the gateway is not public, and localhost is not a wall.

The gateway exposes routes that write keychain entries, register MCP servers by
argv, install packages, and run an edit-and-execute agent loop. Binding
127.0.0.1 stops remote hosts and nothing else: every local process reaches it,
and a browser that resolves a name to 127.0.0.1 reaches it too unless the Host
header is checked.

Three layers, all cheap:

  1. A bearer token the caller must know. Compared with compare_digest so the
     comparison time does not reveal how much of a guess was right.
  2. A Host allowlist. This is what defeats DNS rebinding, and it does not
     assume the token stayed secret.
  3. A JSON content-type requirement on state-changing methods. A form-encoded
     or text/plain body is a CORS-simple request that any page can send without
     a preflight; requiring application/json forces one.
