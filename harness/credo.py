"""credo.py -- the belief, held steady across every surface, retrievable.

The project-docs of a tool family drift apart unless the belief itself is an
artifact: one canonical text, content-addressed, served by the gateway and
echoed in every README. This is that artifact. Change it here and the hash
moves everywhere it is checked.

Flywheel and its tool family hold one belief steady across every surface:

1. Knowledge is an open surface for anyone who can attain the means;
   we build to lower the means.
2. The work speaks for itself: an external check decides acceptance;
   never reputation, never the model.
3. Every result carries a receipt a stranger can re-run.
4. No claim without its interval; the honest null is a first-class result.
5. Ownership is earned by comprehension: you own what you can review,
   explain, and defend.
6. Learning is woven into the work: every flagged gap is a lesson about
   your own system.
7. The badge and the contribution were bundled; we rebundle them around
   the work, not the worker.

Growth, learning, knowledge, application, ownership: in that order,
for everyone.
