"""acceptance_criteria.py -- criteria that only a NAMED oracle can flip.

An agent loop that grades its own "done" claim can talk itself past a bar it
never cleared. This module is the fix: a criterion starts FAILING, and the
only function that can move it is apply_oracle_result, and only when the
caller's `oracle` string matches the oracle name registered on that criterion
at creation time. A model's prose is never that string; it is a name a human
or a real check (pytest, check_writing.py, ...) supplies. That keeps "the
loop reports done" and "the criterion is PASSING" two separate facts.

Single-mutation-point discipline: there is exactly one place in this file's
source that assigns to a criterion's "status" key -- inside
apply_oracle_result. tests/test_acceptance_criteria.py greps this file and
asserts that count is 1. A second assignment site would be a second place a
criterion could flip, silently reopening the exact hole this module exists
to close, so the count is the enforcement, not a description of intent.
