"""map_elites.py — quality-diversity archive (MAP-Elites), from the Swansea
ACM T-IIS study (Walton et al. 2026).

MAP-Elites illuminates the BEHAVIOR space: a grid indexed by behavior
descriptors, each cell holding the highest-fitness candidate in that niche.
Unlike best-of-N (keeps only the winner -> converges, early fixation), the
archive keeps DIVERSE candidates across niches — including ones that aren't
the global best but fill a unique cell. The Swansea study measured this on
humans: galleries with diverse designs (including bad ones) prevented early
fixation and boosted exploration. That's our awg_ucb option-diversity principle
in its established algorithmic form, peer-validated.

Compose with M3: best-of-N populates a MAP-Elites archive; the archive's
diverse_set() resists wrong-attractor convergence and feeds M6 search a spread
frontier instead of a single seed.
