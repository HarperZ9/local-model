"""parity.py -- the capability matrix, witnessed not asserted.

Every Flywheel row names a WITNESS inside this repo (a module, a route
string in the gateway source, a test file) and the audit CHECKS it: a row
whose witness is missing reports ABSENT, so the matrix can fail. Competitor
cells are dated DECLARATIONS from public docs and configs, never
measurements; they are labeled as such and carry no verdict weight. The
summary names both what is uniquely witnessed here and where the field is
ahead -- the gap list is the point, not the scoreboard."""
