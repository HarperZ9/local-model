"""live_feeds.py -- fresh signal across every operator domain, with provenance.

The intake half that feeds.py (the normalization layer + domain map) was
always waiting for: a curated roster of public feeds per domain, fetched
through the gather lane so every item carries provenance, and tagged with
the domain it serves. Art, science, accountability, programming, design,
marketing -- the same surface a person, a model, and the desktop all read.

Honesty mechanics: a dead feed is a NAMED error while the rest arrive; the
roster itself ships in the payload so coverage is visible, never silently
capped; and nothing here fetches until a caller asks (a fetch is a request,
not a heartbeat)."""
