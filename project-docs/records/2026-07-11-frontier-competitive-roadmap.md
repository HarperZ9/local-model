# Frontier competitive roadmap (2026-07-11)

Distilled from a six-axis web-grounded research sweep (routing, verification,
agentic-harness landscape, context/memory, provenance, evaluation). Citations
marked **[real]** are pre-2026 and independently known; **[swept]** were fetched
and marked verified by the research agents on 2026-07-11 but not re-checked here,
so treat their exact IDs as moderate-confidence until reconfirmed.

## The wedge

Three axes converged on one thing: a visible-test-only accept gate is **gameable**,
and the 2025-2026 fix is oracle/trajectory **integrity against reward-hacking**.
This is the purest expression of Flywheel's own thesis (a check that can fail AND
cannot be tricked into passing), and no competitor ships it. It is the durable
differentiator to lead with.

Discipline that makes the receipts mean something (both correctly REJECTED by the
sweep as thesis-breaking): do NOT add an **LLM-as-judge accept gate** (learned
model on the accept path, what most incumbents ship), and do NOT adopt **KV-cache
benchmark encoding** for the hard lane (learned-model dependency on task admission).

## Ranked wins (all zero-dep, no learned model on the accept path)

| # | Win | Effort | Status | Grounding |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Reward-hacking integrity guard** (refuse a tampered pass; ledger trajectory flags) | S-M | **SHIPPED 2026-07-11** `harness/integrity.py` | RLVR reward-hacking; SpecBench [swept] |
| 2 | Non-learned verifier ensembling (consensus over test + property + metamorphic) | M | **SHIPPED 2026-07-11** `harness/consensus.py` (ConsensusOracle + RepeatConsistencyOracle) | Weaver / FUSE / BoN-MAV [swept] |
| 3 | Sample-agreement escalation gate (k-sample agreement before escalating) | S | next | Semantic Agreement, EMNLP 2025, 2509.21837 [swept] |
| 4 | Held-out / adversarial oracle tier (accept needs a check the model never saw) | M | **SHIPPED 2026-07-12** `harness/consensus.py` accept_gate + Task.held_out_cmd + PytestOracle cmd_attr | SpecBench [swept]; UTBoost weak-test finding [swept] |
| 5 | Constraint-pinning in compaction (never fold gate/policy text away) | S | **SHIPPED 2026-07-12** `harness/compaction.py` (pin_roles + pinned flag; verify_compaction reworked) | Governance-Decay [swept] |
| 6 | Deterministic LexRank compaction fallback (replace "first line, truncated") | S | **SHIPPED 2026-07-11** `harness/compaction.py` (default fold) | LexRank, 1109.2128 [real] |
| 7 | in-toto/DSSE receipt shape + full-length hashes (drop 64-bit truncation) | S | **SHIPPED 2026-07-11** `harness/envelope.py` (to_in_toto_statement / to_dsse_envelope / content_sha256) | SLSA / in-toto / Sigstore / C2PA [real] |
| 8 | Zero-dep MCP client so /api/agent calls OUT to the MCP ecosystem | M | **SHIPPED 2026-07-12** `harness/mcp_client.py` (MCPClient + as_external_tools; gated allow_mcp, witnessed; programmatic wiring, HTTP server-spawning deferred pending allowlist) | MCP now table-stakes across all incumbents |
| 9 | Cost/success-rate-ordered failover chain (stdlib frequency-table bandit) | M | **SHIPPED 2026-07-12** `harness/router_stats.py` (RouterStats + circuit breaker; opt-in on /v1/chat/completions, GET /api/router/stats) | Cascade Routing, 2410.10347 [swept] |
| 10 | Curated ~100-task hard lane + contamination freshness gate | S-M | **GATE SHIPPED 2026-07-12** `harness/hard_lane.py` (freshness/admit mechanism); dataset fetch to ~100 tasks remains ongoing curation | Terminal-Bench 2.0, LiveCodeBench, SWE-bench-Live [swept]; SWE-bench Verified now deprecated for eval |
| + | Signed per-tool-call receipts (HMAC authenticity in the loop) | S | **SHIPPED 2026-07-12** `harness/tool_receipts.py` + run_agent sign_key | verification axis [swept] |
| + | MCP-server allowlist for the HTTP surface | S | **SHIPPED 2026-07-12** `harness/mcp_client.py` MCPAllowlist + open_mcp | harness-landscape [swept] |
| 11 | Merkle-tree world root with inclusion/consistency proofs | M | **PRIMITIVE SHIPPED 2026-07-12** `harness/merkle.py` (root/proof/verify, RFC 6962); wiring into world.py root pending | RFC 9162 [real] |

## 2026-07-12 functionality-extension batch (beyond the numbered roadmap)

Public flywheel `16e623f`. Six capabilities, all stdlib + tested + thesis-preserving:
adaptive routing (`router_stats.py`), agent tools grep/glob/apply_patch
(`local_tools.py`), Merkle receipts (`merkle.py`), `flywheel verify` receipt re-check
(`verify_receipt.py`), oracle-gated sub-agent fan-out (`fan_out.py`), agent-loop SSE
streaming (`on_event` + `POST /api/agent` stream), and OpenAI-compatible
`/v1/embeddings` (routed to a provider). Remaining lower-priority: wire Merkle into
the world root, content-addressed fold-index recall, hard-lane dataset curation.
| 12 | Content-addressed fold index for exact-text recall (mem0-class, no vectors) | M | | Context-Folding, 2510.11967 [swept] |
