# File gate burn-down: scripts and tests (frozen 2026-07-26)

The 300-line gate applies to every file in scripts/ and tests/ as well as
harness/. These violations predate enforcement of the gate over these two
trees and are frozen at their current size. A file on this list may shrink
and leave it; it may never grow. New files may not join it.

The harness/ tree has its own frozen record dated 2026-07-25. Both files are
loaded and merged by scripts/check_file_gate.py; keys are tree-prefixed and
do not collide. Kept separate because each was frozen on the day its tree came
under the gate, and a frozen record should not be rewritten after the fact.

Enforced by scripts/check_file_gate.py and tests/test_file_gate.py.

Total: 46 files (36 in scripts/, 10 in tests/), 29932 lines over a 300-line gate.


Merge note, 2026-07-28 (p1/tail x main):
test_qcr_amplitude_manifest.py reached this size on the main lineage,
which carried no file gate. Frozen at merge size under this record's
own rule: shrink and leave, never grow.
