"""compute_arms.py -- the arms of section 4, computed offline from the cache.

Same two refusals as compute_endpoint, imported from it rather than restated:
no run_end means no arms, and a missing pair stops the run. Section 7 allows one
confirmatory pass with no interim analysis, and a tool that reads outcomes has
to be unable to run early rather than merely disinclined to.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DECIDE. The oracle is the scorer in every arm. The only
question an arm asks is whether the oracle also got to be the SELECTOR, and
whether that earned anything. `harness/pool_arms.py` holds that distinction and
`paired()` enforces it on `scored_by`, so this driver just supplies pools and
accept functions and writes down what came back.

Every accept function here is BOUND to the instance the candidate was asked
about. That is not a detail: an unbound accept scores a certificate for a 2x2
problem as a clean PASS against a 28x39 instance, which would inflate every arm
by exactly the candidates that answered an easier question.

Stdlib only. No GPU, no network.
