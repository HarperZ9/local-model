"""writing_pysource.py -- the prose inside Python source, and nothing else.

Phase 1 recorded the gap this closes: pointing the linter at a .py file scored
its string DATA as prose, so the ban lists tripped their own linter. The prose
of a Python file is its docstrings and comments; string literals are payload.
Both scoring paths use this extraction: per-file scoring and --delta.

In the --delta path the front-matter profile tag is resolved from the
EXTRACTED prose, where docstrings precede comments; a tag written as a code
comment may fall outside the first 10 lines there. Tag .py files in the
module docstring's opening lines when delta scoring matters.

Standard library only.
