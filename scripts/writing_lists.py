"""writing_lists.py -- the slop word lists, as data with one home.

Moved out of check_writing.py so the engine file stays under the 300-line gate
as Phase 2 checks land. These lists are exactly the ones the Phase 1 engine
shipped with; moving them changed no entry. Phase 3 added the report-check
patterns and the gate data (HARD_DEFAULTS, KNOWN_CATEGORIES,
REPORT_ONLY_CATEGORIES); Phase 4 added HEDGE_WORDS.

Standard library only.
