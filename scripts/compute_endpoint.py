"""compute_endpoint.py -- turn the completed pools into the preregistered endpoints.

Section 7 of the frozen preregistration allows ONE confirmatory run with no
interim analysis and no peeking. The walker was therefore built unable to read a
verdict. This tool is the other half of that: it reads verdicts, so it is built
unable to run before the pass is over.

Two refusals carry that, and neither has an override flag, because an override
is how a rule becomes a suggestion:

  * **No run_end, no endpoint.** The mechanical journal must carry the walk's
    own completion record. A partial pool is exactly the state in which a
    tempting early look is possible, so this is the state the tool refuses.
  * **No missing pair, or no endpoint.** The primary endpoint is defined over
    the union of bodies produced by ALL rungs. Computing it over the rungs that
    happen to be present would answer a different question under the same name,
    so a missing pair is named and the run stops.

Tests satisfy both guards honestly, by pointing the tool at a fixture pool whose
journal really does carry run_end, rather than by switching the guards off.

Stdlib only. No GPU, no network: every number here is a function of the cache.
